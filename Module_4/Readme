# Module Overview: Regression Analysis and Model Evaluation

In this module, we will cover key concepts and techniques related to regression analysis and model evaluation. The module focuses on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation using Python.  

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Understand Regression Models:**
   - Define the explanatory variable and the response variable.
   - Differentiate between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models.

2. **Model Evaluation and Visualization:**
   - Evaluate models using visualization techniques in Python.
   - Learn to interpret R-squared and Mean Square Error (MSE) for in-sample evaluation.

3. **Polynomial Regression and Pipelines:**
   - Apply polynomial regression techniques in Python.
   - Transform data into a polynomial and use linear regression to fit the parameters.
   - Utilize pipelines for efficient data transformation and modeling.

4. **Prediction and Decision-Making:**
   - Predict outcomes and make decisions based on Python data models.
   - Determine whether a model is appropriate for given data.

5. **Additional Concepts:**
   - Define and understand the term "curvilinear relationship."

By the end of this module, you will have a strong foundation in regression analysis, enabling you to evaluate models, implement advanced regression techniques, and make data-driven decisions confidently.
